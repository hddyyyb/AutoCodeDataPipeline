# Dataset Schema Definition

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the unified dataset schema used in AutoCodeDataPipeline.

The schema supports:
- Repository-grounded QA instruction tuning
- Architecture-level design tasks
- Auditable reasoning and traceability

---

## 2. Common Structure

All samples are stored in JSONL format.

Common fields:
- sample_id
- task_type (qa / design)
- language
- text (training-ready)
- meta (grounding and audit metadata)

---

## 3. QA Sample Schema

Key fields:
- question
- answer
- evidence
- trace
- meta_v2

### Evidence

Each evidence item must reference a valid `chunk_id` from the repository index.

### Trace

The trace captures a **lightweight, auditable reasoning path**.

Important constraints:
- Minimum reasoning steps are enforced
- Each step must be grounded by evidence
- Free-form chain-of-thought is explicitly avoided

---

## 4. Design Sample Schema

Design samples include:
- requirement
- design_output (structured object)
- evidence_snippets (original code)
- trace_digest

Minimum reasoning depth is enforced to ensure explainability.

---

## 5. Evidence and Trace Constraints

- Each sample must contain at least one valid evidence block
- `evidence_snippets` must include original code
- QA: trace ≥ 2 steps
- Design: trace ≥ 3 steps

These constraints are enforced during post-processing and inference validation.
