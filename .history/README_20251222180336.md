# AutoCodeDataPipeline

AutoCodeDataPipeline is an end-to-end engineering pipeline for generating
**auditable, repository-grounded training data** from a local codebase,
designed to support domain-specific LLM fine-tuning and evaluation.

The project targets two scenarios:
1. **QA generation** based on business rules and execution flows extracted
   from a code repository.
2. **Architecture and design task generation** constrained by the existing
   repository structure.

This project is developed as a response to the interview assignment:
*“Local Code Repository–Based Intelligent Training Data Generation and Processing.”*

## 1. End-to-End Pipeline Overview

The pipeline transforms a local code repository into structured datasets
(and optionally validates them via lightweight model adaptation):
